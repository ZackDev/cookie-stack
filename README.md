# Cookie Stack

A Firefox browser extension for viewing and deleting cookies.

The add-on adds an icon to the toolbar of your browser, displaying the number of cookies currently set. Click the icon to get an overview of domains they belong to. Expand and contract those domains by clicking the down or up facing arrow to view specific cookies. Delete a cookie by clicking the trash icon.

# How to use it:

* point the browser to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
* click `Load Temporary Add-On`
* select `manifest.json` file from `cookie-stack`'s root directory

* if your browser is in private mode, go to `about:addons`, and allow `Cookie Stack` to run in private windows.
